            Fluffy is an African pygmy hedgehog. Unlike European hedgehogs, Fluffy is white coloured and cannot hibernate.

        <b-card title="Nocturnal">
          <p class="card-text">
            Hedgehogs are nocturnal and prefer to be awake during night time hours. Hedgehogs do not like bright light. Fluffy usually wakes up in the evening but isn't active until the late hours of the night.<br><br>
            It is normal for Fluffy to look sleepy for a while after waking up. During her active time she likes to run in her wheel, eat cat-food and drink water. Any other time that she is active she will just mill around. She is not known to be playful with the balls, tunnels, or other toys we have left in her box, but she will walk around them with a curious demeanor.

        <b-card title="Behaviour">
          <p class="card-text">
            Fluffy can not see or hear much, she navigates mostly by smell and responds defensively to new or changing smells.<br><br>
            You might witness Fluffy contorting to lick her own back leaving a frothy residue in her quills. This is called 'anointing'. It looks strange, but it is perfectly natural. We're not sure why hedgehogs anoint. Our favorite theory is that she likes to collect smells and rub them onto herself as a disguise against potential predators following her scent.<br><br>
            Hedgehogs defend themselves by realigning their quills into all directions and sometimes also curling up into a ball, where they are covered entirely in spikes. This is accompanied by 'huffing' where the hedgehog hisses and jerks in an attempt to scare off any threats. Huffing can force quilts into anything touching the hedgehogs, be careful not to put your hand too close.<br><br>
            Defensive curling and huffing is an instinctive reaction to being disturbed.

        <b-card title="Handling">
          <p class="card-text">
            Hedgehogs are always defensive at first, this is instinctive and no matter how familiar you are with them they will curl up on every first contact.<br><br>
            When handling Fluffy for the first few times, be close to the floor, laying or sitting down. This is for Fluffyâ€™s protection. Hedgehogâ€™s have delicate legs which could break easily, any fall higher than 5cm above the ground should be considered capable of injuring the hedgehog.<br><br>
            Keep one of the small felt blankets at hand, if you ever find yourself needing to move Fluffy but are unable because of her spines, you can wrap the cloth around her and gently pick her up without hurting yourself.<br><br>
            Do not interfere with Fluffy while she is eating or drinking from her bowls or running in the wheel, she needs to know that those spaces are safe spaces where she can maintain her own health without any disturbances.

        <b-card title="Hibernation">
          <p class="card-text">
            It is thought that hedgehogs can curl up into a ball and stay that way for months at a time for hibernation, this may be true for European hedgehogs. Fluffy likes to sleep on her side during the day, in a soft warm place. We have given her a blue sleeping bag made of felt.<br><br>
            If Fluffy gets cold, or experiences a sudden temperature drop, making her expect to be cold. Fluffy will attempt to hibernate. She will instinctively lower her body temperature and her immune system will stop in preparation for low-energy rest. African pygmy hedgehogs can not actually hibernate and can not survive if left to be cold. If Fluffy is cold to the touch, and/or sluggish, then she has had a hibernation attempt, and must be gently warmed up to normal body temperature (20-30degrees Celsius) as soon as possible. She will continue to be sleepy/sluggish after a hibernation attempt. Her immunity will also be less active, so leave her in her box (except for warming up if using body temperature) until she displays signs of her usual curious, eating and drinking self.<br><br>
            To prevent hibernation attempts overnight, when the house is coolest, we have a microwavable hot water bottle to leave in her tank, under her sleeping bag. The heating instructions are on the pad itself and it stays warm for about 10 hours.

        <b-card title="Nutrition">
          <p class="card-text">
            Fluffy lives on a diet of water, cat food, and (optionally) live mealworms. We make sure that there is about a quarter cup of each of the water and cat food in her feeding bowls every night. She does not always eat all of it and she is able to self-regulate how much she needs to eat. She will eat more if she has been running more.<br><br>
            Hedgehogs make their mess while they are running. We keep Fluffy's wheel in her litter tray. She has been trained to use the litter tray, and will often do so while running in the wheel. The litter we use is great at absorbing the smell!
